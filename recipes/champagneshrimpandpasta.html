    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Champagne shrimp and pasta is elegant enough for company yet very simple to make, especially if you purchase
        shrimp that has already been
        peeled.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups champagne</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to
            the bite, 6 to 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large pan. Cook and stir mushrooms in hot oil until
            tender. Remove mushrooms from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine shrimp, champagne, and salt in the same pan over high heat. Cook until liquid just begins to boil,
            then remove shrimp from the pan. Add shallots and tomatoes to champagne; boil until liquid is reduced to 1/2
            cup, about 8 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup cream; boil until slightly thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Return shrimp and
            mushrooms to sauce in the pan and cook until heated through. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Toss hot, cooked pasta with remaining 1/4 cup cream and parsley in a large bowl. To serve, spoon shrimp with
            sauce over pasta and top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
